Waves Company is a studio and production unit I’m building to craft **immersive spatial
experiences, brand environments, and narrative-driven installations**. The focus is on making
ideas tangible through design, fabrication, and media—bridging concept to execution.

What defines Waves:
- A hybrid team structure that moves fluidly from strategy to production.
- Strong emphasis on atmosphere, materiality, and sensory detail.
- A pipeline built for rapid iteration—from prototypes to full-scale builds.

Waves exists to help brands and cultural spaces translate their stories into **memorable physical
and digital moments**.
