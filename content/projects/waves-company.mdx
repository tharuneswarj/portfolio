I’m building Waves — a digital craft studio exploring how computation, fabrication, and material honesty can come together to create meaningful objects.

Waves began with a simple question: if we can automate making, how do we preserve emotion?
Today, anyone can 3D print. But why we print — and what we choose to make — matters.

At Waves, I design and fabricate algorithmic light objects using computational design and digital fabrication. Each piece is grown layer by layer through custom code, intentional geometry, and carefully chosen materials. No mass production. No templates. Every object carries its own digital fingerprint.

This isn’t about showcasing technology for its own sake.
It’s about using machines thoughtfully — to slow down, to feel texture, to experience light as atmosphere rather than output.

What I’m building goes beyond lamps. Waves is evolving into a broader practice around digital craft — spanning lighting, sculptural objects, installations, and eventually architectural-scale fabrication. The goal is to bridge design, engineering, and sustainability, and to prove that digital fabrication can be conscious, tactile, and deeply human.

Digitally crafted. Consciously made. Emotionally felt.
