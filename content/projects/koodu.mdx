Koodu Architecture is the studio I am building to focus on **context-aware, people-first
architecture** and thoughtful material expression. The practice is rooted in slow, research-led
design—balancing clarity, craft, and the realities of construction.

What I’m building with Koodu:
- Residential and small-scale public projects with strong site response.
- Collaborative workflows that bring clients, makers, and consultants into the process.
- A portfolio shaped by long-term learning, prototyping, and documentation.

Koodu’s name (Tamil for “nest”) reflects a belief in creating spaces that **hold people with care
and precision**—spaces that feel grounded, calm, and intentional.
