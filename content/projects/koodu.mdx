**Koodu** (Tamil for “Nest”) is a conceptual architecture lab and workspace where ideas of making, imagination, and technology intersect.  

The project explores the role of **computational workflows**, **digital fabrication**, and **collaborative learning** in shaping the future of architectural practice.

The space functions as:
- A workshop for **fabrication experiments**  
- A hub for **computational design research**  
- A playground for **robotic and 3D-printing experiments**  

Ultimately, Koodu represents my vision of a **nest for architects and makers** to come together and push boundaries.
