## Koodu — a practice shaped like a nest

*Koodu* means **nest**.  
A place of care, patience, and making things with intention.

Koodu is a design-led **architecture and craft practice** that I’m building with **Arjun**. The practice grew from a simple belief: good design comes from slowing down enough to ask better questions — *how is this made, why does it feel right, and what does it mean to live with it every day?*

Our work spans **architecture, interiors, furniture, and objects**, moving fluidly between scales. A building detail and a chair joint are treated with the same seriousness. Drawing, prototyping, fabrication, and construction are not separate phases for us — they’re part of one continuous conversation.

## What we’re building

At Koodu, we’re interested in the overlap between **traditional making** and **contemporary digital tools**.

On one side, we focus on:
- Craft, material honesty, and local building wisdom  
- Hands-on making, joinery, and construction logic  
- Spaces that feel warm, grounded, and lived-in  

On the other, we explore:
- Computational and parametric design  
- Digital fabrication and rapid prototyping  
- Workflows that help designers think *through* making, not just draw outcomes  

Technology is never the point by itself. We use tools — digital or manual — only when they help us think better, build better, or waste less.

## How we work

Koodu is intentionally small and collaborative. We work closely with clients, fabricators, and consultants, often testing ideas through models, mockups, and 1:1 experiments. Many projects evolve through iteration — making, breaking, and remaking — until the idea feels inevitable.

We care about **quiet clarity**:
- Clear concepts  
- Thoughtful material choices  
- Details that reward close attention  

## An evolving practice

This page isn’t a finished manifesto. It’s a **living record** of what we’re building — projects, experiments, failures, prototypes, and lessons along the way.

Koodu is still growing.  
Like any good nest, it’s being built twig by twig.
