The **3D-Printed Lamp Studio** is an exploration of how computational design and additive manufacturing can redefine everyday objects.  

Using **parametric modeling** in Rhino and Grasshopper, I designed a series of lamps that combine structural efficiency with visual elegance.

Each prototype was printed with PLA and clay, experimenting with different textures, translucency, and geometry.  

Key explorations:
- Parametric surface perforations for light diffusion  
- Organic forms generated from algorithms  
- Exploring the boundary between craft and digital fabrication
