This ongoing body of work lives at the intersection of **3D printing, computational design, and
material science**. I build custom printers, author Grasshopper-driven toolpaths, and test
material behaviors to expand what digital fabrication can do in architectural production.

Current explorations:
- Designing and fabricating bespoke clay and polymer extrusion systems.
- Generating G-code directly from Grasshopper for fine-grain control.
- Studying how material viscosity, curing, and temperature affect form.

The goal is to create **repeatable yet expressive fabrication workflows** that can scale from
research to real-world architectural applications.
