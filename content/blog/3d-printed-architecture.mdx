I’m building **Waves**.

Not just a lamp brand.  
Not just a 3D printing experiment.

But an ongoing exploration of how digital tools, craft, and material responsibility can coexist — without losing emotion.

This page is not a launch announcement.  
It’s a log. A record. A place to think out loud while building.

## Why Waves Exists

We live in a time where making things has become incredibly easy.

You can download a file, hit print, and have an object in a few hours. The internet is flooded with printable lamps, objects, and forms — clever, complex, and often impressive.

But I kept coming back to the same question:

**Why are we making these things?**

Why are we printing objects that could be injection-molded?  
Why are we adding more plastic without asking what it means?  
Why does so much of digital fabrication feel visually loud, yet emotionally empty?

Waves is my response to that discomfort.

## What I’m Actually Building

At its core, Waves is a **digital craft studio**.

I design and fabricate light objects using computational design and digital fabrication — primarily 3D printing — but with a very specific intention:

- Each object is **grown**, not generated  
- Each form is guided by **code**, but finished with **human touch**  
- Each material choice is questioned, not assumed  

The lamps I make are not mass-produced. They’re not templated.  
Each one carries its own rhythm — a digital fingerprint shaped by geometry, toolpaths, and time.

This isn’t about pushing machines to their limits.  
It’s about using them carefully.

## Light as an Experience, Not a Product

I don’t think of these objects as “products” first.

I think of them as experiences of light.

Soft light.  
Diffused light.  
Light that calms a space instead of dominating it.

In Waves, imperfection is not a flaw.  
It’s evidence of process.

The layers are visible.  
The making is not hidden.

## Where This Is Going

Right now, Waves lives at a small scale — lamps, objects, experiments.

But the long-term vision is much larger.

I want to explore:

- Larger sculptural pieces  
- Custom-built fabrication tools and printers  
- Hybrid processes combining digital fabrication with wood, metal, and hand-finishing  
- Spatial installations and architectural-scale objects  

Waves is a bridge — between architecture and objects, between code and craft, between automation and care.

## Why I’m Writing This Publicly

This blog exists so I don’t pretend I have it all figured out.

I’ll be sharing:

- What I’m building  
- What works  
- What fails  
- What I’m questioning  
- How my thinking evolves  

Some entries will be technical.  
Some will be reflective.  
Some might just be notes from the workshop at 2 a.m.

That’s the point.

## Current Status

As of now:

- Waves is live  
- The first objects exist  
- The process is slow, rough, and deeply educational  

And that feels right.

If Waves is about anything, it’s about **slowing down in a world obsessed with speed** — even when using machines designed to go fast.

I’ll keep updating this page as Waves grows.

Layer by layer.
