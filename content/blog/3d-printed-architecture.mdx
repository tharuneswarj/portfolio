# 3D Printing in Architecture: Beyond Prototypes

When most people think of 3D printing, they imagine **tiny plastic prototypes** on a desktop machine. But in architecture, the possibilities are far greater.

Today, we’re seeing **large-scale 3D printing** with materials like concrete, clay, and even recycled plastics—shaping everything from pavilions to entire houses.

---

## 🏗 Real-World Examples
- **Apis Cor** printed a house in 24 hours in Russia.  
- **ETH Zurich** has pioneered 3D-printed concrete slabs and walls that are structurally efficient.  
- Studios like **WOOJ Design** and **Shinkogeisha** are using 3D-printed lamps and furniture as scalable businesses.

## 🌍 Why This Matters
3D printing can:
- Reduce material waste (print only what’s needed).  
- Enable **complex geometries** that would be impossible with traditional methods.  
- Speed up prototyping for client presentations and competitions.

## 🧪 My Experiments
Recently, I’ve been working with a **custom-built delta 3D printer** for clay and ceramic. The goal is to create **functional lighting pieces** that merge computational design with digital fabrication.

Here’s what excites me most:
- Exploring new **material behaviors** (how clay bends, cracks, or flows).  
- Linking **Grasshopper-generated geometries** directly with print paths.  
- Building a workflow that connects **parametric design → fabrication → finished product**.

> The future of architecture isn’t just drawn—it’s fabricated. And 3D printing is one of the bridges between the digital and the physical.
